Dining Philosophers Problem - C Implementation

## Overview

The problem simulates five philosophers sitting around a table, each alternating between thinking and eating. They share five forks (one between each philosopher). To eat, a philosopher must pick up both forks to their left and right. The challenge is to design a system that avoids deadlock and starvation.
